## Tackling the issue

I managed to do most of the task minus the line graph, due to time constaints. I wanted to show a variety of skills so I've added testing, mock service worker and atomic design. I also mocked up a design for the case study which I followed. The intention was to showcase my skillset rather than rush and finish the task in a sloppy manner. Of course there is still room for improvement as is the case with these matters but hopefully it gave you enough to showcase my skills. However, as I haven't finished the task I would understand if you do not want to proceed with the application.
