# Plan of Action

- I'll need three pages: Home, Login, Account
- Tech stack should be pretty simple, I think besides React, TS and tailwind I should look into form validation using zod and react query as it supports auto caching
- As you don't have access to endpoints use mock service worker
- Use vitest and react testing library for testing, don't go overboard on testing, just enough to show that I'm capable of testing
- Take accessibility into consideration too!

## Home Page

This should be a pretty simple homepage, some welcome text, a navbar to login/sign up or if you are logged in to go to your account

## Login

- Simple page
- Use zod for form validation and any sort of error handling on the front end
- for now set the credentials as a local storage item but do take into consideration how to expand on that

## Account Page
